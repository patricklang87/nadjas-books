<h1 align="center">Nadja's Books</h1>

<p align="center">This is a landing page for an imaginary cafe and bookshop. My goal was to make a stylistically attractive, though subtle, layout using CSS. The page includes a carousel (written from scratch in JS) and an embedded location map from OpenStreetMap.org.</p>
